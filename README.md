# 57_List_inChainOfNodes

Implementing a list using chain of Nodes, a user-defined class.

An analogy can be made with trains:
- A Node object is essentially a train cart.
- The train cart can hold cargo; a Node object can store a reference to an object (the cargo).
- The train cart can be linked to the next train cart, or none; a Node object can store a reference to the next Node.
- The train's first cart is where the driver is; a chain of nodes list has a headReference to refer to the first Node.
